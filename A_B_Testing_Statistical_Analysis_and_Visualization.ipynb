        "This project implements a Python script to calculate the statistical significance of A/B test results across various user segments. By leveraging data from Google BigQuery, the script dynamically analyzes key conversion metrics such as `add_payment_info / session`, `add_shipping_info / session`, `begin_checkout / session`, and `new_accounts / session`. Unlike manual online calculators, this automated approach efficiently computes z-statistics and p-values for the overall test and also provides granular insights by segmenting results based on traffic channel, device type, and top-performing countries. The final output is a structured DataFrame containing all necessary information for subsequent data visualization, enabling a deeper understanding of how different user groups respond to the A/B test."
